# Python Generator Implementations

The Pop Jump Push and Koda-Ruskey algorithms for generating all ideals of an arborescence are implemented along with a basic command line interface for exploring and benchmarking.

Use `--help` for argument details but the most important bits are
the output types

    0 performance timing
    1 algorithm arguments dump
    2 raw algorithm output
    3 ideals node output in native algorithm order
    4 ideals node output from native to sorted preorder (for comparing output)

and the sample data

    'set_Alpha', 'set_7Readme', 'set_Ruskey', 'set_13M',
    'set_3B', 'set_3W', 'set_3D',
    'set_7B', 'set_7W', 'set_7D',
    'set_15B', 'set_15W', 'set_15D',
    'set_31B', 'set_31W', 'set_31D',
    'set_53X',
    'set_63B'

The number represents the number of nodes and `B` is for a fully balanced tree, `W` for wide and `D` for deep. The others are for specific testing, like comparing Pop Jump Push output ordering to the Koda-Ruskey ordering.

`set_63B` takes a while on my machine when using python (pypy) so a shorter `set_53X` is available that executes in ~ 25 seconds when executed using pypy.

When using these algorithms in python I highly suggest using pypy (or another jit compiler). Compare the following `per ideal` timings, the first using `python` and the second using `pypy`.

`> python .\python\main.py -a 2 -o 0 -s set_53X -r 5

```

```python
    for _ideal in generator:
        i += 1
